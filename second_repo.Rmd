A (max) 2,000 word proposal created with R Markdown.
The proposal will:
* Be written in R Markdown.
* State your research question. And justify why it is interesting.
* Provide a basic literature review (properly cited with BibTeX).
* Identify data sources and appropriate research methodologies for answering your question.

##Research Question
Our researching question is based on whether the Internet accesibility rate has a direct impact on the students academic ability and the economic growth. Currently, it can be argued that not having a proper Internet accessibility can decrease the potencial of the students when learning. Moreover, this can also be harmful for the GDP growth, because future generations will not be prepared to apply new technologies and, therefore, losing the chance to apply one of the most efficient methods to produce benefits. (see @savage2005broadband) (see @dimaggio2001social)

##Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that ***Internet accessibility is beneficial for both student's academic record and economic growth***.

##Data Sources and Methodologie
###Data Sources
We will refer "World DataBank" and Central Intelligence agency(CIA)'s "Factbook" and  use datas. Likewise, we also will use the "QOG dataset 2016." A recopilation of data made by the University of Gothenburg. We will use data on education and internet infrastructure.

QOG Data: http://qog.pol.gu.se/data/datadownloads/qogstandarddata
World DataBank (WDI): http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx

###Methodologie
Our methodologie will be based on data on ***Internet Accesibiity***, ***Qualith of Education System***, ***Average Schooling Years***, and ***GDP Growth Rate*** of all the countries. Then we will analyze the correlation between them in order to answer our researching question. 
Our research will be quantitative. Quantitative methods emphasize objective measurements and the statistical, mathematical, or numerical analysis of data collected through polls, questionnaires, and surveys, or by manipulating pre-existing statistical data using computational techniques. This quantitative research will focus on gathering numerical data and generalizing it across groups of people or to explain how influential is the internet accessibility when improving education and growth.
